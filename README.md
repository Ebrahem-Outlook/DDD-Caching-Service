# DDD-Caching-Service Documentation
Overview
The Produce Service is built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles. It leverages a variety of technologies and patterns to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability. This service runs in Docker containers using PostgreSQL for production and SQL Server for local testing. It also employs distributed caching, MediatR for handling commands and queries, FluentValidation, Result pattern, domain events, custom exceptions, API responses, MassTransit, RabbitMQ, and integration events.

Technologies and Patterns
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The service is structured around DDD principles, focusing on the core domain and its logic.

Clean Architecture
The project is organized to separate concerns and dependencies, following Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture.

PostgreSQL and SQL Server
PostgreSQL: Used in production environments.
SQL Server: Used for local development and testing.
Distributed Caching
Implemented using Redis to improve performance and scalability.

MediatR
Used for handling CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns.

FluentValidation
Applied for validating incoming requests and commands.

Result Pattern
Used for handling errors and exceptions effectively, encapsulating the result of an operation.

Domain Events
Implemented to capture and handle significant business events within the domain.

Custom Exceptions
Defined to handle specific error scenarios in a controlled manner.

Result API
Standardized API responses to ensure consistency and clarity.

MassTransit and RabbitMQ
Used for messaging and integration events, enabling communication between microservices.

Integration Events
Defined to facilitate event-driven architecture and communication.

Running the Project
Local Environment
Ensure you have SQL Server installed locally.
Update the connection strings in appsettings.Development.json.
Run the application using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.
