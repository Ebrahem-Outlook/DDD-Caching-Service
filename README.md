- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Clean Architecture**
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- **Event Sourcing**
- **FluentValidation**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **MediatR for handling commands and queries**
- **Logging**
- **Caching with Redis**
- **Docker and Docker Compose for containerization**
- **API Gateway**
